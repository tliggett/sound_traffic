# GOALS LIST

## Visualization side
1. Get the geocoordinates for mile markers (possibly on data side)
2. Display traffic network
3. Display traffic by average/rush hour
4. Display traffic by times

## Data side
1. Geocoordinates?
2. Figure out average traffic -> times
3. Figure out how number of lanes impacts times
4. Self driving car times

## Math side
1. Research traffic mathematics
2. See if people have done similar things
