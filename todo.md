# GOALS LIST

## Visualization side
1. Utilize tableau to produce better visualizations for the project

## Data side
1. Annotate Jupyter Code
2. Use regression (bayesian?) to find percentages of over threshold
3. Calculate lane increases to flow and percentage of traffic in number of lanes 
4. Find a better measure than overflow percentage?

NOTE: Would it make more sense to figure out sum overflow over percentage?
DO A FEW DIFFERENT MEASURES AND THEN DO A LINEAR REGRESSION OFF OF ALL OF THESE?
