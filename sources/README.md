# Sources

This folder will house source papers we are using for the project. When adding a source, take the time to add a source and description to the list below.

## List of sources with descriptions
+ **Traffic Flow Optimization using Reinforced Learning**, *Erwin Walraven*: Erwin talks a lot about ITS (Intelligent Transportation System). Not necessarily relevant to the self driving cars solution, but it is mentioned briefly and gives some insignt into how traffic flow can be assisted by machine learning.
+ **Macroscopic traffic flow models (chapter 9)**: macroscopic traffic flow models discussed. Describe dynamics of the traffic flow.
